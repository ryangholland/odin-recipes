    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>8 ounces flank steak</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon vegetable oil (plus 1/3 cup for frying)</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon soy sauce</li>
      <li>
        1 tablespoon cornstarch (plus 1/4 cup for dredging, divided; if doubling
        the recipe, increase cornstarch accordingly)
      </li>
      <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
      <li>1/4 cup hot water (or hot low sodium chicken or beef stock)</li>
      <li>
        1/4 cup low sodium soy sauce or 1 1/2 tablespoons water and 2 1/2
        tablespoons regular soy sauce
      </li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon ginger (minced)</li>
      <li>5 dried red chili peppers (optional)</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic (chopped)</li>
      <li>
        1 tablespoon cornstarch (mixed with 1 tablespoon water to make a slurry)
      </li>
      <li>2 scallions (cut into 1-inch long slices on the diagonal)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Combine the sliced beef with 1 teaspoon oil, 1 teaspoon soy sauce, and 1
        tablespoon cornstarch. Marinate for 1 hour. The beef should still be
        quite moist after it has marinated. If it looks too dry, add a
        tablespoon of water to it.
      </li>
      <li>
        Next, dredge the marinated beef slices in the remaining 1/4 cup of
        cornstarch until lightly coated.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a small bowl, mix brown sugar and hot water (or low sodium chicken or
        beef stock) until the sugar is dissolved. Mix in 1/4 cup low sodium soy
        sauce. If you don't have low sodium soy sauce, substitute 2 1/2
        tablespoons regular soy sauce and 1 1/2 tablespoons water. The saltiness
        of various soy sauce brands varies, so give the sauce a taste, and
        adjust the amounts of sugar/soy sauce/water/stock to your own taste.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat 1/3 cup vegetable oil in the wok over high heat. Just before the
        oil starts to smoke, spread the flank steak pieces evenly in the wok,
        and sear for 1 minute (depending upon the heat of your wok). Turn over
        and let the other side sear for another 30 seconds. Remove to a sheet
        pan. Tilt it slightly to let the oil drain to one side (lean it on a
        cookbook or cutting board). The beef should be seared with a crusty
        coating.
      </li>
      <li>
        Drain the oil from the wok, leaving 1 tablespoon behind, and turn the
        heat to medium-high. Add the ginger and dried chili peppers, if using.
        After about 15 seconds, add the garlic. Stir for another 10 seconds and
        add the premixed sauce.
      </li>
      <li>
        Let the sauce simmer for about 2 minutes and slowly stir in the
        cornstarch slurry mixture. Cook until the sauce has thickened enough to
        coat the back of a spoon.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the beef and scallions and toss everything together for another 30
        seconds. There should be almost no liquid, as the sauce should be
        clinging to the beef. If you still have sauce, increase the heat
        slightly and stir until thickened. Plate and serve with steamed rice!
